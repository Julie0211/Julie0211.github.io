Hello! I'm Julie, a first year computer science major.

## Favortite Computer Science 120A Labs

LAB 6, PART 2
This is one of my favorite labs.  I was having a hard time in all honesty,
I had a hard time with If statements, but my partner was super helpful!  My 
partner showed me how to use them better than I had known before, the whole lab 
was fun. 

LAB 1 
Lab one will always have a place in my heart haha! It was my first time coding
in such a long time.  I was nervous to be in the class but the girl i was partnered 
with was super nice and we were able to help each other through the process. 

LAB 2
Lab 2 has to also be a memorable one.  I learned a lot from my partner during this lab. 
I was also able to code from home for the first time for this lab because I got a Linux 
Computer!
